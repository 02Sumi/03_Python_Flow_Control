# 03_Python_Flow_Control

## Introduction üëã

Control flow statements are an essential part of the Python programming language.

A control flow statement is a block of programming that analyses variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. In simple sentence, a control structure is just a decision that the computer makes. So, it is the basic decision-making process in programming and flow of control determines how a computer program will respond when given certain conditions and parameters. It determines the  order in which the program‚Äôs code executes.

They are **decision making statements** that allow the program to take the decision as which statement should be executed next.

Decision Making statements are used when we want a set of instructions should be executed in one situation and different instructions should be executed in another situation .Decision making can be implemented in python using:

**`if`** statements

**`else`** statements

**`elif`** statements

**`for`** loops

**`while`** loops

**`break`** statement

**`control`** statement

**`pass`** statement

## Frequently asked questions ‚ùî

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can ‚≠ê star this tutorial. Starring is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/03_Python_Flow_Control) if you aren't here already and click the "‚≠ê Star" button in the top right corner. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? ü§î

1. Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/03_Python_Flow_Control) if you aren't here already.
    
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of the page, then click "[Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/03_Python_Flow_Control/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)".

    ![Download ZIP](img/dnld_rep.png)

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
4. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Cell > All Output > Clear`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
