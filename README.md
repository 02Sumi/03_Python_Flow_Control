# 03_Python_Flow_Control

Control flow statements are an essential part of the Python programming language.

A control flow statement is a block of programming that analyses variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. In simple sentence, a control structure is just a decision that the computer makes. So, it is the basic decision-making process in programming and flow of control determines how a computer program will respond when given certain conditions and parameters. It determines the  order in which the programâ€™s code executes.

They are **decision making statements** that allow the program to take the decision as which statement should be executed next.

Decision Making statements are used when we want a set of instructions should be executed in one situation and different instructions should be executed in another situation .Decision making can be implemented in python using:

**`if`** statements

**`else`** statements

**`elif`** statements

**`for`** loops

**`while`** loops

**`break`** statement

**`control`** statement

**`pass`** statement
